**Hello World!** üëãüèΩ

I'm Msingathi aka Msi, I'm a Technical Product Manager with 10+ years bridging engineering execution and business strategy. I build blockchain products from 0‚Üí1‚Äîtaking concepts through user research, PRD creation, technical implementation, and live deployment on Solana, Hedera, and Tron networks.

</n><u>**What Drives Me**</u></n>

* **Crypto & Payments Innovation**: Deep diving into how blockchain platforms like Solana and Hedera are revolutionizing financial infrastructure. Through user research and competitive analysis, I've identified key adoption barriers in crypto UX and built test prototypes exploring solutions. Fascinated by Solana's Account Model and its implications for payment systems, while exploring Hedera's enterprise-grade consensus for institutional fintech applications.

* **User-Centered Technical Excellence**: Bridging the gap between robust testing frameworks, infrastructure monitoring, and the scalable systems needed for next-generation financial applications. My freelance user research work has taught me that technical excellence means nothing without product-market fit‚Äîproducts must serve consumers, not just engineering teams.

* **Market-Driven Innovation**: Through competitive analysis across diverse products since 2019, I've seen how market competition drives meaningful product improvements. I actively contribute to crypto discussions in professional spaces, always with an eye toward practical implementation and user adoption.
