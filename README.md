Hello Future! 👋🏽
I'm Msingathi, building the bridge between technology and business impact.
Currently positioning myself for Product Management roles, leveraging my expertise in crypto, fintech, and AI to drive innovation. I believe in the power of emerging technologies to solve real-world problems and create meaningful user experiences.
🧠 What I'm Passionate About
Blockchain & DeFi: Deep diving into platforms like Solana and Hedera, exploring how their unique architectures solve scalability and cost challenges. Fascinated by Solana's Account Model and NFT ecosystem, while intrigued by Hedera's enterprise-grade consensus mechanism backed by tech giants. Always curious about what separates platforms that gain traction from those with strong fundamentals but slower adoption.
Product Strategy: Translating complex technical concepts into user-centric solutions, bridging the gap between engineering possibilities and market needs.
Emerging Tech: Staying ahead of AI trends and fintech innovations that reshape how we interact with technology and money.
